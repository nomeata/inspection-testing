synopsis:            GHC plugin to do inspection testing
description:         Some carefully crafted libraries make promises to their
                     users beyond functionality and performance.
                     .
                     Examples are: Fusion libraries promise intermediate data
                     structures to be eliminated. Generic programming libraries promise
                     that the generic implementation is identical to the
                     hand-written one. Some libraries may promise allocation-free
                     or branch-free code.
                     .
                     Conventionally, the modus operandi in all these cases is
                     that the library author manually inspects the (intermediate or
                     final) code produced by the compiler. This is not only
                     tedious, but makes it very likely that some change, either
                     in the library itself or the surrounding eco-system,
                     breaks the libraryâ€™s promised without anyone noticing.
                     .
                     This package provides a disciplined way of specifying such
                     properties, and have them checked by the compiler. This way,
                     this checking can be part of the ususal development cycle
                     and regressions caught early.
                     .
                     See the documentation in "Test.Inspection" or the project
                     webpage for more examples and more information.
